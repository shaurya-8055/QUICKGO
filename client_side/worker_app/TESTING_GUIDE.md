## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Network Error" in Flutter App

**Cause:** API base URL incorrect

**Solution:**

- For Android Emulator: Use `http://10.0.2.2:5000/api` ✅ (Already set)
- For iOS Simulator: Use `http://localhost:5000/api`
- For Physical Device: Use `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5000/api`

**To find your IP:**

```powershell
ipconfig
# Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter
```

---

### Issue 2: "Signup Failed" Error

**Check Backend Terminal:** Look for error messages

**Common Issues:**

- Phone number format wrong (must include country code: +91)
- Password too short (minimum 6 characters)
- Services not selected (at least 1 required)
- Duplicate phone/email (worker already exists)

**Backend Error Examples:**

```javascript
// Phone validation error
{ "success": false, "message": "Invalid phone number" }

// Duplicate worker
{ "success": false, "message": "Worker with this phone or email already exists" }
```

---

### Issue 3: Backend Not Responding

**Check:**

1. Backend terminal is still running
2. No errors in backend logs
3. MongoDB connection still active

**Restart Backend:**

```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
Set-Location -Path "c:\Users\Asus\Desktop\complete_ecom_app_random_87129001_a1234_codeing_123\client_side\worker_app\server"
node server.js
```

## 📊 What Happens During Signup?

1. **Flutter App sends POST request:**

```json
POST http://10.0.2.2:5000/api/auth/worker/signup
{
  "phone": "+919876543210",
  "name": "Test Worker",
  "password": "password123",
  "email": "test@worker.com",
  "serviceType": ["AC Repair", "Electrician"],
  "city": "Mumbai"
}
```

2. **Backend validates data:**

   - Phone format check
   - Password length check
   - Email format check
   - Duplicate check

3. **Backend creates worker:**

   - Hashes password with bcrypt
   - Saves to MongoDB
   - Generates JWT token

4. **Backend sends response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Worker registered successfully",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "worker": {
      "_id": "67218abc...",
      "phone": "+919876543210",
      "name": "Test Worker",
      "email": "test@worker.com",
      "serviceType": ["AC Repair", "Electrician"],
      "city": "Mumbai",
      "isAvailable": false,
      "isOnline": true,
      "rating": 0,
      "completedJobs": 0,
      "totalEarnings": 0
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Flutter App saves:**
   - JWT token → Local storage
   - Worker data → Local storage
   - Navigates to home screen

---

## 🎯 What to Test Next

After successful signup/login:

### ✅ Profile Screen

- View worker details
- Check KYC status (Aadhar, PAN - not verified yet)
- See bank details section (empty initially)
- View earnings (₹0 initially)

### ✅ Available Jobs Screen

- Should show "No jobs available" (no jobs created yet)
- Location permission might be requested

### ✅ Availability Toggle

- Toggle "Available for Jobs" switch
- Should update backend
- Check backend logs for: `PUT /api/workers/availability`

### ✅ Profile Update

- Update name, email, city
- Should save to MongoDB

---

## 📱 Testing from Client App (Future)

To test the complete flow:

1. **Client App** creates a job request
2. **Worker App** sees job in "Available Jobs"
3. **Worker** accepts job
4. **Worker** completes job
5. **Both apps** see updated status
6. **Worker** receives earnings

## 🔑 Test Credentials

Save these for testing:

**Worker 1:**

- Phone: `+919876543210`
- Password: `password123`
- Services: AC Repair, Electrician

**Create more workers** with different phone numbers to test multiple workers.

        Motia is an all-in-one framework for modern backend systems. Out of the box support for API endpoints,
        background jobs, scheduled tasks and agentic workflow orchestration through a unified runtime. Thanks to its
        event driven architecture you can run tasks in parallel, stream data to clients, or allow for seamless
        orchestration of flows.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's start with <b>Workbench</b>, it is a development tool provided by Motia's ecosystem, from here you'll be
        able to visualize your flows and observe their behavior.
        <br />

        The <b>CRON</b> Step config has a distinct attribute, the <b>cron</b> attribute, through this attribute you will

        the <i>trace id</i> associated to your Step's execution.

        <br />
